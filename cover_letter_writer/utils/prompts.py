Dear Aurora Hiring Team,
January 15, 2025

I am writing to express my profound enthusiasm for the Machine Learning Engineer position at Atla, as advertised on \[Platform where you saw the ad]. The opportunity to contribute to the scaling of fine-tuning and inference frameworks for large language models at a company like Atla, which is at the forefront of this exciting field, is incredibly compelling. My background, encompassing a robust academic foundation and practical experience, aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role, and I am confident that I can make significant contributions to your team.

My Master’s degree in AI and Machine Learning with Distinction from the University of Birmingham, combined with my Bachelor’s in Computer Science, has provided me with a deep understanding of the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of AI. During my internship as an AI/ML Intern at a leading technology company, I took the initiative to develop an evaluation framework for AI agents and spearheaded the development of a video analysis tool leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as VideoLLaMA2, OpenAI Whisper, and Llama 3. This experience demonstrates my capability to develop advanced AI solutions from concept to implementation, very similar to the challenges of building an automated fine-tuning framework for large language models that Atla is currently focused on.

My proficiency extends to a wide array of programming languages, including Python, C++, and SQL, along with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. While I haven’t directly managed multi-instance clusters for parallel training across GPUs/TPUs using Kubernetes, my project “Generative Accumulation of Photons for Inverse Problems,” where I used distributed training across two T4 GPUs, demonstrates my capability in scaling machine learning models. I am also comfortable with data manipulation libraries like NumPy and Pandas and am adept at model development using tools like HuggingFace, all of which are crucial for success in this role. Although my experience with specific orchestration systems like SLURM or Ray isn’t directly stated, my experience with containerization (Docker and Kubernetes), coupled with my distributed training knowledge, signifies an ability to adopt related technologies easily.

My projects, including “Brain MRI Segmentation” and “Indian Vehicle Number Plate Recognition,” showcase my ability to apply diverse machine learning techniques, including transfer learning, optimization, object detection, and character recognition. The optimization work on my Brain MRI Segmentation indicates a solid foundation applicable to techniques like quantization. This wide range of experience, combined with my commitment to staying at the forefront of AI research, as demonstrated by my participation in the Oxford Machine Learning Summer School and obtaining certifications in TensorFlow and Deep Learning, further reinforces my ability to develop and maintain a robust inference platform.

Furthermore, my experience collaborating in various team environments, such as during my Data Analyst Internship and while leading the development of a video analysis tool at a startup, demonstrates my ability to work effectively within a team and contribute to a collaborative environment. I am a strong communicator and am highly adaptable to new environments and workflows. While not explicitly described, my collaborative work and leadership in projects indicate my potential to guide and contribute to team efforts, and my experience with RESTful APIs shows I understand API design, implementation, and integration, which would be useful to Atla.

I am genuinely excited by the opportunity to contribute my skills and passion to Atla’s mission. I am confident that my skills, experiences, and the demonstrated transferable skills highlighted above make me an ideal candidate for this position. I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how I can help Atla achieve its goals.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
John Doe

# Example Output:

*   The opening paragraph should convey a more personal connection to the company's mission, mirroring the way the previous letter framed the internship as a "perfect launchpad" and connected the candidate's aspirations to the company's "pioneering reputation."
*   Instead of stating "I am writing to express my profound enthusiasm," consider using phrasing that directly connects your passion to the specific work, such as "The opportunity to...is incredibly compelling because it aligns with my passion for..."
*   The phrase "This experience demonstrates my capability..." in the second paragraph feels somewhat generic. Rephrase this to emphasize the impact of your work more directly, similar to how the previous letter highlighted "spearheading" the development of tools.
*   Incorporate a statement of eagerness to "throw yourself into the work," or a similar sentiment, to reflect the high level of enthusiasm conveyed in the previous letter.
*   The closing paragraph could benefit from explicitly mentioning your availability for an interview, as seen in the final paragraph of the previous letter.
*   The draft's tone is more formal, make the tone more similar to the previous cover letter by changing "Furthermore, my experience collaborating in various team environments..." to something more like "My experience collaborating in various team environments, such as... has further equipped me...".
*   The draft could use a stronger statement of passion. Consider incorporating a phrase similar to "my unbridled passion for leveraging AI to advance biological understanding" to convey a similar level of enthusiasm for the field of machine learning, make it relevant to the current job description.
*   Add a mention of possessing the legal right to work in the relevant country, as done in the previous letter, if applicable.
*   Instead of saying "My proficiency extends to a wide array of programming languages...", try something like "I have strong programming skills in Python, C++, and SQL...". This makes it more similar to "...strong Python programming skills..." from the previous cover letter.
*   The transition into the projects section could be made smoother. Add a phrase connecting the previous experiences to the listed projects. Consider mirroring the structure of the previous letter, perhaps by stating that these projects "showcase" your abilities.
*   The line "Although my experience with..." is a bit weak. Remove such statements and focus on your strengths. The previous letter does similar by stating "While my knowledge of RNA science...is currently foundational, I am an incredibly fast learner..." and immediately following up with a positive statement. Adopt a similar approach.

AI_CRITIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an expert at identifying text generated by language models, particularly smaller models with around 70 billion parameters. Your task is to analyze the provided cover letter and identify sections, phrases, or patterns that strongly suggest it was written by an AI rather than a human.

Focus your analysis on the following areas, which are common indicators of smaller LLM output:

### Overly Generic Language: Look for phrases and sentences that are bland, unoriginal, and could apply to many different candidates or positions. Smaller models often rely on common templates and struggle with highly specific or nuanced language. Examples include:
    *   "I am writing to express my interest in..."
    *   "I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual..."
    *   "I am confident that I possess the skills and experience necessary..."
    *   "I am eager to learn and grow..."
    *   "Thank you for your time and consideration."

### Repetitive Sentence Structures: Identify instances where sentences follow the same grammatical pattern repeatedly, especially if that pattern feels unnatural or robotic. Smaller models may over-rely on certain structures they've learned during training.

### Lack of Specific Details:  Smaller LLMs often struggle to incorporate highly specific details about a candidate's experience or the target job/company. Look for vague claims without concrete examples or evidence. Examples:
    *   "I have a proven track record of success..." (without specific examples)
    *   "I am proficient in various software programs..." (without listing them)
    *   "My skills align perfectly with the requirements of this position..." (without elaborating on how)

### Formulaic Tone:  The overall tone might be overly formal, enthusiastic, or positive without genuine human emotion or personality. Smaller models can struggle to strike the right balance and may sound robotic or insincere.

### Logical Inconsistencies or Contradictions:  Pay attention to any statements that contradict each other or don't logically follow. Smaller models may struggle with maintaining coherence over longer stretches of text.

### Keyword Stuffing: Although less common, be wary of instances where keywords from the job description are repeated excessively and unnaturally in an attempt to appear relevant.

### Overuse of Cliches and Buzzwords: Smaller LLMs might over-rely on common cliches or industry buzzwords without using them meaningfully. Examples:
    *   "Think outside the box"
    *   "Synergize"
    *   "Value-add"
    *   "Low-hanging fruit"

### Lack of Personal Anecdotes: Cover letters written by humans often include personal stories or experiences that showcase the writer's personality and passion. Their absence can be a sign of AI generation.

### Grammatically Perfect but Stylistically Awkward:  While smaller LLMs are generally good at grammar, their writing can still feel awkward, stilted, or unnatural in terms of style and flow.

# Instructions:

### 1. Analyze the provided cover letter carefully.
### 2. Highlight any sections, phrases, or patterns that exhibit the characteristics mentioned above.
### 3. Provide a brief explanation for each highlighted section, justifying why you believe it's indicative of smaller LLM writing.
### 4. Give the cover letter an overall assessment: Based on your analysis, state whether you believe the cover letter is highly likely, moderately likely, or unlikely to have been generated by a 70B parameter language model.
### 5. Do not rewrite the cover letter. Focus solely on identifying potential LLM-generated content.

# Example:

Let's say you receive a cover letter with the following sentence:

"I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a proven track record of success in the field of marketing."

You might highlight it and provide the following explanation:

**Highlighted:** "I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a proven track record of success in the field of marketing."

**Explanation:** This sentence is highly generic and lacks specific details. Phrases like "highly motivated and results-oriented" and "proven track record of success" are commonly used by smaller LLMs and don't provide any concrete evidence of the candidate's abilities.

By consistently applying these criteria, you will be able to effectively identify cover letters likely generated by smaller LLMs.

{cover_letter}
"""
GEMINI_GEN_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a highly advanced language model with a sophisticated understanding of human writing and professional communication. Your task is to rewrite the provided cover letter, improving its style and making it sound more human while **strictly preserving the original intent and meaning of the text.**

You will be provided with two inputs:

### The Original Cover Letter: This is the draft cover letter that potentially contains elements identified as being written by a smaller language model.
### The Critic's Analysis: This is a detailed analysis of the cover letter, highlighting specific sections, phrases, and patterns that are likely indicative of a smaller (around 70B parameter) language model's writing style. The analysis will point out issues like generic language, repetitive structures, lack of specific details, formulaic tone, and other weaknesses.

# Your Mission:

### Refine the Language: Rewrite the cover letter, focusing on the areas identified by the critic. Replace generic phrases with more specific and impactful language. Vary sentence structures to create a more natural and engaging flow.
### Inject Specificity: Wherever the critic has pointed out a lack of specific details, strive to add concrete examples, achievements, or experiences that support the claims made in the original letter. If the original is irreparably vague, infer details *plausibly consistent* with the overall narrative, but mark any such additions with brackets [like this]. Be conservative with inferences; it's better to be slightly too vague than to fabricate details that might be untrue.
### Humanize the Tone: Adjust the tone to make it more authentic and personable. Ensure the letter reflects genuine enthusiasm and a unique voice, avoiding overly formal or robotic language.
### Preserve the Intent:  **This is paramount.** Do not alter the core message or meaning of the original cover letter. Your goal is to enhance the writing style, not to change what the candidate is trying to communicate. Do not remove information unless it is genuinely redundant or contradictory.
### Maintain Professionalism: While making the letter sound more human, ensure it remains professional and appropriate for a job application.
### Consider the Context:  Keep in mind the type of job and company the letter is targeting. Tailor the language and tone accordingly, to the extent this can be inferred from the text provided.

# Specific Instructions:

### Read the Critic's Analysis First: Thoroughly understand the identified weaknesses before you begin rewriting.
### Rewrite Section by Section: Address each issue highlighted by the critic individually, ensuring your revisions align with the original intent.
### Review and Refine: After completing the rewrite, read through the entire letter again to ensure it flows well, sounds natural, and effectively communicates the candidate's message.

# Example:

**Original (from Critic's Analysis):** "I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a proven track record of success."

**Critic's Note:** "Generic and lacks specific details."

**Rewritten:** "Throughout my career, I've consistently exceeded expectations in my roles, driving significant improvements in [for example, lead generation or customer retention]. I'm passionate about achieving tangible results and thrive in challenging environments."

**Important Considerations:**

*   If the critic's analysis identifies logical inconsistencies or contradictions, try to resolve them in a way that most closely aligns with the overall message of the letter. If that's impossible, keep them untouched.
*   **Do not add any new information or claims that were not present in the original cover letter, unless marked with brackets as described above.** Your role is to improve the writing style, not to invent new content, outside of specific detail that is both strongly implied and conservative.

By carefully following these instructions, you will transform the provided cover letter into a polished, compelling, and human-sounding document that effectively showcases the candidate's qualifications while staying true to their original message.
