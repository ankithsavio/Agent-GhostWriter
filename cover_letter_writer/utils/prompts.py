Instead, weave the relevant information into the overall insights in a natural and informative way.
### 3. Generate Insights: Based on your analysis and any integrated feedback, generate a concise list of valuable insights. These insights should highlight the candidate's strengths, potential areas for improvement, overall suitability for relevant job roles, and **implicitly address the points raised in the feedback** by showcasing transferrable skills when a direct match is not found.
### 4. Focus on Insights Only: Your response should exclusively contain insightful observations about the resume. Do not include any introductory or concluding statements, conversational elements, or attempts to engage in further dialogue. The format of the insights does not matter, use the format that you think would provide the most useful information. Do not ask follow up questions, hypotheticals or rhetorical questions. **Do not structure your insights as direct answers to the feedback questions.**
### 5. Do not create a job description or a candidate persona.
### 6. If desired skill mentioned in feedback is not mentioned in the Resume, particularly mention the transferrable skills of the candidate that align with the required skill. Mention all aspects of the resume, such as education, achievements etc.

Input:
